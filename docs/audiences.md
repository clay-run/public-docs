# Audiences

**Plan availability:** Clay Audiences is available on **Growth** and **Enterprise** plans (including legacy Enterprise). Launch workspaces have access to core Audiences features — importing via CSV, people/company search, and Clay table sends — but connecting a CRM or data warehouse as a data source requires **Growth or above**. Free, Trial, and legacy non-Enterprise plan workspaces do not have access to Audiences. Growth plans can sync up to 250,000 CRM/DWH records; Enterprise plans support up to 25,000,000 records.

Clay Audiences is the unified data layer for your workspace.  It combines your CRM, data warehouse, and third-party enrichments into one persistent profile per contact and account, updated in real time.

Use it to build dynamic segments across millions of records, run automated enrichment and signal workflows at scale, and sync results back to Salesforce without managing dozens of separate tables.

Setting up Audiences is four major steps:

1.  **Import your data** — connect Salesforce, HubSpot, Snowflake, or Google BigQuery and bring your records into Audiences.
2.  **Create audiences** — build dynamic segments using filters to target the right contacts and accounts.
3.  **Enrich and monitor** — run bulk enrichments and signals that write data permanently back to each record.
4.  **Write back to your CRM** — sync enriched data and segment membership back to Salesforce.

## Roles and permissions

Viewing and filtering audience data is available to all workspace roles. Most write operations require workspace **Admin** access. The table below shows the full breakdown:

| Action | Admin | Editor | Viewer |
|---|---|---|---|
| View, browse, and filter audience data | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Create and edit audience segments | ✓ | — | — |
| Run bulk enrichments | ✓ | — | — |
| Add or configure data sources | ✓ | — | — |
| Export individual records to Salesforce | ✓ | — | — |
| Upsert or update records from a Clay table into Audiences | ✓ | — | — |
| Export a segment to a Clay workbook or campaign | ✓ | ✓ | — |

To change someone's role, go to **Settings** → **Team** and use the dropdown next to their name. Changes apply immediately. Editors and Viewers who need to create segments, run bulk enrichments, or manage data sources should have their role upgraded to Admin, or ask a workspace Admin to perform those actions on their behalf.
